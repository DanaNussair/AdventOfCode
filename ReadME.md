# Advent Of Code
This is the solution to a month long challenge by the ZeroToMastery Udemy courses.

## [Day One](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
- Part 1:
  - Given a list of numbers find two numbers that sum up to `2020`, then multiply them and print the result.
- Part 2:
  - Same as challenge number one but instead find three numbers.

## [Day Two](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2)
- Part 1:
  - Given a list of passwords and password rules `(min-max character)`, find how many passwords contain a specified character with count falling between the given min/max numbers (inclusively)
- Part 2:
  - Given the same list of passwords and password rules `(first_position-second_position character)`, check the specified character's position and make sure that it is the same as only one of the positions provided and count how many passwords fall within the rule.


## [Day Three](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/3)
- Part 1:
  - Given an list of `.#` combinations creating a map where `#` represents a tree and `.` represents an empty pathway, traverse the map in the directions given and count how many trees you encounter along the way. The direction for part one is `go three elements to the right and one row down (3, 1)`
- Part 2:
  - Same as part 1 but get the multiplication of an array of directions. In this case `(3, 1), (1, 1), (5, 1), (7, 1), (1, 2)`
