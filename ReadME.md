# Advent Of Code
This is the solution to a month long challenge by the ZeroToMastery Udemy courses.

## Day One
- Part 1:
  - Given a list of numbers find two numbers that sum up to 2020, then multiply them and print the result.
- Part 2:
  - Same as challenge number one but instead find three numbers.

## Day Two
- Part 1:
  - Given a list of passwords and password rules (min-max character), find how many passwords contain a specified character with count falling between the given min/max numbers (inclusively)
- Part 2:
  - Given the same list of passwords and password rules (first_position-second_position character), check the specified character's position and make sure that it is the same as only one of the positions provided and count how many passwords fall within the rule.
